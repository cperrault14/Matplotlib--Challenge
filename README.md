# Matplotlib-Challenge
Matplotlib Challenge for 2021 Data Analytics Bootcamp


     Here are some concepts that were covered in this Matplotlib Project:

      a. Calling out dependencies such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Spicy.Stats, Numpy libraries and their functions.
  
  
      b. Creating dataframes, merge datasets, applying left joins, groupby statements.


      c. Calculating mean, average, median, variance, standard deviation, standard error of mean, line of regression, correlation coefficient.


      d. Creating summary tables to display summary data.


      e. Plotting bar graphs, pie charts using Pandas and using pyplot.


      f. Creating whiskerplots, scatter plots and line of regression.
      
      
      g. Looping through dataset to calculate and print values in one sitting.

    Hypothetically:  As a senior data analyst at ymaceuticals Inc., I've been given access to the complete data from the company's most recent animal study. 
    
    In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development 
    was observed and measured. 
    
    The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 
    I have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team 
    also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

    Based on my knowledge of Python, Jupyter Notebook and several statistical libraries in Python, my analysis led to the production of the following: 
  
        a. A summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

        b. A bar plot using both Pandas's and Matplotlib's that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.
        
        c. A box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.
        
        d. A scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.
        
        e. A scatter plot with its linear regression line.
